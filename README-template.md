## My process

Started off with first visualizing the layout in my head and where to assign classes.
Started from the mobile view down to the desktop view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Never under estimate any challenge, always pay attention to little detail and try to first always visualize the layout in your head before you start coding.

### Continued development
I want to get a very good understanding of the grid system and use of animations, peusodo classes and transformation CSS properties.
